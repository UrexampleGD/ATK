A.T.K Things.

Well, this is mission that it's really hard. It's suppose to be an logger. What logger exactly? Well, I cannot tell what this is and it is not disturbing or whatever stuff is that.

--# [Bypasser]
The second mission is easy. As for the 5000+ members of coder (but I'll just pick 5 of them), they must somehow bypass and get an module from any website chosen and will gain a unique roles.

--# [The Recover Cheats]
Not a mission but somewhat a thing for them to do, they must recover something precious to us, A.T.K. That we lost but can't recover it.

--# [Key Program]
Vest Is blus, NEXt are nectar.

--# [Null]
Null, a coded bot that controls something forbidden. This is for an emergencies and we cannot tell it.



-- If you are not from A.T.K and read all of them, we forgive you this time for not using code to IP Log you.
-- I'm also sorry if I offend you guys owner, leaking something that could not be telled or whatsoever.

But if you're wondering what is A.T.K is.. It's a part of many coders gather that and the group was suppose to be private.. There will be no leaks of the server.
